Feedback - Jodie

Hey Joseph :wave: Just messaging to give you some feedback on your wireframe. 
Looking great so far! I would recommend adding the state in your component tree 
for reference later on :+1: I'd also suggest writing the expected frontend paths 
for each page eg. /, /article/:article_id, /articles/topic/:topic_name. 
Hope this helps!
