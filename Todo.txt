install vite 
npm install vite@latest 

install axios 
npm install axios 

install react Router 
npm i -D react-router-dom

in the app file, import the following: 

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { Routes, Route } from'react-router-dom'

check the dependancies have been added to the package.json file 
- axios / react-router-dom etc...  and any others you installed. (vite probably won't show) 




In the main file, update the file to the following: 

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
)



Use Render for your api 
When you click on the link once its all created 
e.g https://nc-news-gjgw.onrender.com
add the /api on the end. otherwise it may give a 404 error code.
